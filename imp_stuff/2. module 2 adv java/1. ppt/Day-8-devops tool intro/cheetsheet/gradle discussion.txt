What is Gradle ?
---------------
Gradle is completely an open-source build automation tool that is based on Apache build tools Maven and Ant.
It introduces a  Kotlin and Groovy-based DSL(Domain Specific Language)instead of XML (Extensible Markup Language) for declaring the project configuration. 

Gradle facilitates an elastic model that helps us in the development lifecycle from compiling and packaging source code for web and mobile-based applications.

It provides support to build, test, and deploy software on different platforms. 
Gradle is developed to build automation on many programming languages and platforms, including Java, Android, Scala / C ++, and Groovy. Gradle can be integrated with several development tools and servers, including Eclipse, Jenkins, and Android Studio.

Some Leading Enterprise companies like LinkedIn, Google, and Netflix use Gradle
It has been developed to basically overcome the drawbacks of Maven and Antand supports integration with a range of IDEs.



Why Gradle ?
--------
Free and open-source
       Gradle is a completely open-source project and licensed under the Apache Software License (ASL).

High Performance
         Gradle very quickly executes the task by reusing the output from the previous task execution and it also processes tasks whose only input is changed and executes the task in parallel.

Highly Customizable
         Highly customizable and extensible.

Performance
       Faster than Maven in all scenarios including large builds using build-cache.

Flexibility
       It is a flexible tool. Gradle is a plug-in-based build tool.
       It creates our plug-in in a different programming language
       It creates a plug-in and gives control to our codebase.

Multi-project build support
        Powerful support for the multi-project builds

Extensibility
      Gradle can be easily extended to provide our task types or build models.

Incremental Builds
         If we compile our source code using Gradle then it will check if the sources have changed since the previous execution. If the code is modified or changed then it will be executed but if the code is not changed or modified then it will skip the execution and the task is marked as updated.

Familiar with the Java
     You need a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run the Gradle, so your machine should have a Java Development Kit (JDK). Bonus for developers as we can use the standard Java APIs in our build logic

Gradle Wrapper 
        Gradle Wrapper usually allows us to execute Gradle builds on machines where Gradle is not installed.

User Experience
    Gradle provides a wide range of IDEâ€™s to improved user experience.
    It provides a command-line interface that offers many powerful features like Gradle Tasks, Command line completion, and more. It also provides a very interactive web-based UI for debugging and optimizing builds.




commands:
---------
gradle init
gradle build
gradle run
gradle task
gradle task --all
gradle -q mytask



gradle task:


task myTask{
	description = 'this is my custom hello world task'
	group ='this is my group'

	doFirst{
		println 'welcome to my tutorial'
	}
	doLast{
		println 'done to my tutorial'
	}
}

how to list:

gradle task --all


how to run:
gradle -q myTask



Another example:
-------------------
task myTask{
	description  "this is my custom hello world task"
	group "this is my group"

	doFirst{
		println "welcome to my tutorial"
	}
	doLast{
		println "done to my tutorial"
	}
}


Example custom tasks:
-------------------


task task1{
	description  "this is my custom hello world task"
	group "this is my group"

	doFirst{
		println "welcome to my tutorial"
	}
	doLast{
		println "done to my tutorial"
	}
}



task task2{
	description  "this is my custom hello world task2"
	group "this is my group"

	doFirst{
		println "welcome to my tutorial2"
	}
	doLast{
		println "done to my tutorial2"
	}
}


task copyReportsDirForArchiving(type: Copy){
	from "$buildDir/reports"
	into "$buildDir/toArchive"
}

task taskX{
 println "i am task X"
}


task taskY(dependsOn: taskX){
 println "i am task Y"
}
