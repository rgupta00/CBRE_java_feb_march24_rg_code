Factory Method pattern
========================
	=> Defind an interface for creating an object, but let subclass decide which 
		object to instantiate, Factory method let a class defer instantiation to subclass using 
		inheritance.

Implementation:
---------------
	=> provide an interface for creating an oblject here do not consider the word interface as java interface. 
	It simply mean to provides a contract / method to create an object

	=> let the subclass decide what exact object ot instantiate- This pattern involve "inheritance"
