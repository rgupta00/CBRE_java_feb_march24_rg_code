Chain of Responsibility
-----------------------

	=> used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request 
	from client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. 

	=>Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will 
	be processing the request and whether the request is 
	required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.

	=> ex:  try-catch block

	=> Ex: ATM Dispense machine, 50$, 20$, 10$ etc
