	Iterator design pattern:
	------------------------
	=> iterator pattern allows for the traversal through the elements
	 in a grouping of objects via a standardized interface. 

	=> An Iterator interface defines the actions that can be performed.

	=>  These actions include being able to traverse the objects and also obtain the objects


	Example : write our own iterator by implementing java.util.Iterator
		 hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods
