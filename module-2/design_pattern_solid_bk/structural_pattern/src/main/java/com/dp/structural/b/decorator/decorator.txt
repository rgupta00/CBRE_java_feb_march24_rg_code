decorator pattern / wrapper pattern 
=================================

	=> Decorator pattern helpful in adding behaviour to objects statically or dynamically.

	=> Decorator pattern helps in extending the functionality of the objects without
	 effecting the behaviour of other objects.

	=> Decorator adhering to the design principle of Open for extension and closed for modification

	=> In the Decorator pattern, a decorator object is wrapped around the original object

 	=> This is typically achieved having the original object as a member
		 of the decorator, with the decorator forwarding the 
		requests to the original object and also implementing the new functionality

	==> The decorator must conform to the interface of the original object
		 (the object being decorated)
