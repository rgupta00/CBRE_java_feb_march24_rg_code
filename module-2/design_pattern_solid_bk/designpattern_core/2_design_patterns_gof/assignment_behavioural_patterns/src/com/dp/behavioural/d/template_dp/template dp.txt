template design pattern:
-------------------------
	=> Template Method is a behavioral design pattern. 

	=> Template Method design pattern is used to create a method stub and 		
		deferring some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.

	=> Template method defines the steps to execute an algorithm and it
	 can provide default implementation that might be common for all or some of 		
		the subclasses.

	=> suppose we want to provide an algorithm to build a house. 
	The steps need to be performed to build a house are 
	 building foundation, building pillars, building walls and windows.

	=>  The important point is that the we cant change the order of execution
	 because we can't build windows before building the foundation.

	=> So in this case we can create a template method that will use different methods to build the house
