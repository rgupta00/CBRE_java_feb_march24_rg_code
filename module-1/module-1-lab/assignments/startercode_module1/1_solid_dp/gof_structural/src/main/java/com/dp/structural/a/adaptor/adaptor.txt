Adapter Pattern
================
	==> It helps in integrating two modules with different incompatible interfaces. 
	==> The Adapter pattern is used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together
	==> The joining between them is called an Adapter. 
	==> This is something like we convert interface of one class into interface expected by the client. 
	==>  Way to implement adaper
		=> Using inheritance: A class adapter 
		=> User composition: An object adapter

	Use cases:
	----------
	1. Most important task of an Adapter is to transfer data between applications or modules.
	2. Very common task is to parse the information from one kind to the other
	3. Convert from one type to the other
	4. Some times adapters even validate the data so that right data flows into the application 
	from external applications.

	=> Having adapters help in keeping the conversion code separate so that the parsing functionality
	 is not leaking into the core modules of our application.

	=> Another important advantage of having an adapter is that when there is a 
	change in outside interface, our core modules does not get affected. 
	Only adapters need to be modified. So, this helps in restricting the changes to 
	 adapter module alone and rest of application does not get affected. 




	Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. 
	Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
